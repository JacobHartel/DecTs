#This is the beginning of my design for DecT's

##This will be a protocol and platform to create collections w/ a twist

###Why isn't there a digital pokemon? Why is the value fractured?
No one has given artists and creators the oppurtunity to expand and nuture their brand.
You come out with an ape and then change it's style....wow ya'll got played. It's boring now
but you still flex. Why?

I believe it's because the value was captured, now the buyers get all of that value. You can't
really expand much more or it devalues what is on the market. 

So here I want artists to really dive into their products and think long term, which seems like a novel thought 
nowadays.

###The Plan

Those details are still being ironed out. I need to research hosting platforms and contract audits.
Still need to ask around about what logic must be in the contract vs what I can put in the backend. 
I believe in this deeply and I cannot say that about much else. So this is for the next creator of 
Pokemon or Yu-gi-oh, hell maybe even magic the gathering. 

Each 'roll' of the dice will be a set price. Either U.S. value or ETH/SOL. With that there will be tiers
of each card. Most will be common, then rare, legendary, and Epic. The algorithm will control the supply of each
style of card. This will create scarcity and and urge to collect them all. I know this exists on other platforms but that is
not specifically to create the next long term collectable. Pokemon is still releasing cards and still making people money.
They enjoy meeting, talking, trading, and battling. 

The moon shot will be that a creator does this, creates something bigger than them or the platform and has a serious impact in society.
A place holder for the times.
