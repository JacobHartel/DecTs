        We want YOU to create the next Pokemon* ONCHAIN. NFT's are largely
        shapeless and shallow images with no correlation other than A DIFFERENT
        COLOR MONKEY....who gives a shit? We were scammed into caring.
        </p>
    <p>
        A bored ape is BORING. It's a entry level dolce handbag for people who DO NOT GO OUTSIDE!
        Why do we have to sit back and watch assholes spend 10k on a stupid F*&%king MONKEY?

        appologies it's not the monkey, it's what it stands for....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

        The creators do this! Artists like YOU create meaning they envoke
        emotions, YOU provide memories for children that start a lifelong bond
        with the world you create for them! Why has everyone forgotten this? I
        DON'T WANT ANOTHER REMAKE. I want YOU create and build the future!

        Crypto wasn’t meant to be a casino for the bulls and bullshitters of
        Wall Street. It wasn’t born to be just another vehicle for greed. It was
        designed to show us something different—a new path forward. A way to
        assign value not just to commodities, but to the ideas, creations, and
        innovations of the digital age.

        I get it—money makes the world spin, and we all need to secure our
        futures. But let’s be honest, the crypto space today is flooded with
        scams, shallow hype, and empty promises. It’s hard not to notice how
        greed poisons what could have been a movement of purpose and change.

        Here, we aim to rewrite that narrative. This isn’t another Faze Clan
        pump-and-dump, nor is it a quick money grab wrapped in buzzwords. This
        is a space for creators and thinkers, for dreamers and builders. A place
        where scarcity isn’t a gimmick but a feature that underlines true value.
        We believe in creating works that stand the test of time, that will be
        collected and cherished for generations—not because they promise profit,
        but because they carry meaning.

        What we’re building here is an environment that shifts focus from
        trading to holding. These aren’t assets designed to flip hands
        endlessly, losing their meaning along the way. They’re digital
        keepsakes, trophies, and artifacts. They’re meant to be part of your
        collection—expressions of identity, history, and creativity you’ll want
        to preserve, not pawn. Owning here isn’t about trends; it’s about
        collecting.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Let’s strip away the noise and get back to the core. This is about
        expression, collaboration, and forging something real in the digital
        realm. If you’re tired of the bullshit, you’re in the right place.
